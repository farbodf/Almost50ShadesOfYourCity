# Almost50ShadesOfYourCity
Project for SomeJam 2015

An innovative tool which helps you to understand a region or city better. We dig into events happening in and around your city, using eventbrite.com. 

Main Usage:

Hunderds of thousand of people move to new cities for job, education and personal reasons, without having any information about the city. This service helps these people and anyone else who is interested in understanding a region better. 
Our service automatically find events and index them and we provide a flexible visualization of the region with different levels of details, for people to access easily.

Future Plan:

Include more sources of Events.
